The Black–Scholes or Black–Scholes–Merton model is a mathematical model of a financial market containing derivative investment instruments. From the model, one can deduce the Black–Scholes formula, which gives a theoretical estimate of the price of European-style options. The formula led to a boom in options trading and legitimised scientifically the activities of the Chicago Board Options Exchange and other options markets around the world. lt is widely used, although often with adjustments and corrections, by options market participants. Many empirical tests have shown that the Black–Scholes price is "fairly close" to the observed prices, although there are well-known discrepancies such as the "option smile".

I believe for anyone who studies math, the BS model is "beautiful"since it provide an explicit solution to a stochastic problem. Here, I am going to implement the Black Scholes model with C++, and show the result and Greeks. For theoratical knowledge of BS, please refer to the link above :).  
I will also use Monte Carlo Simulation method to price an European option. So, in the main funciton you can see I called both class--BS and MC to achieve the purpose.
